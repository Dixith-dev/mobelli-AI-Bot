 * Our story

MOBELLI SOUTH AFRICA WAS BORN OUT OF MY FRUSTRATION WITH HIGH PRICES AND POOR OFFERINGS OF OUTDOOR FURNITURE WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A SUN LOUNGER FOR MY CAPE TOWN HOUSE.

Mobelli South Africa was born out of my frustration with high prices and poor offerings of outdoor furniture when I was looking for a sun lounger for my Cape Town house. I searched for the perfect sun lounger high and low through specialist importers and mass market retailers. Either it was way too expensive and unrealistically priced, or, the furniture was of such low quality, that it was coming apart on the showroom floor.

Eventually my search led me to a well-known retailer in Cape Town which had wooden sun loungers. The price was right, not too expensive, certainly not cheap, and the shape was amazing – a steamer sun lounger made out of Balau wood. This was the lounger I wanted, this is the lounger I had to get, and if they had stock at the time, this would have been the sun lounger I would have bought.

After a 3 month wait, my new sun lounger arrived. It had that wooden smell and a beautiful Brown colour. The care instruction given by the sales people was that I should coat it every 6 months with oil. That alone evoked romantic images in my mind. Hot sun, a beautiful day and myself applying oil, effortlessly, on the wooden furniture, feeding the wood its nutrients. It was man made heaven.

Before I knew it, the time has come to start the “romantic” maintenance project. In hind-sight I can vouch that the process was not romantic at all. I had splinters going into my fingers because the wood had already started cracking. Some of the slats had so little space between them that effective coating was not possible. The lounger had turned to a different colour. No nourishment was ever going to piece it together. In any event, brushing was not the only thing required of me. I had to do sanding and ensure that the floor did not get dirty with oil. I had to work at it – and work hard. It was not fun and I now know that there is no romance in sanding and maintaining furniture.

2 months later, I stepped onto my patio to find the sun lounger hungry – needing more nutrients. I projected my anger at the retailer who sold me the lounger. After all, it had only been 2 months since I slaved over this lounger. The sales people told me that all of their wood loungers required maintenance every 6 weeks. That was too much for me. I could not bear the thought of having to work on my sun lounger 8 to 9 times a year.

I shared this emotional roller coaster with my brother, Aviv. We agreed that there must be a better way, a way where people can buy beautifully designed loungers of good quality at a decent price which requires little maintenance. We wanted to bring outdoor furniture which people could enjoy and use without having to spend too much time cleaning and painting and slaving over them and so Mobelli was born.

Our passion permeates throughout the company. Our customer, our staff and ourselves, know that using Mobelli outdoor furniture is a sure way to increase the enjoyment of the outdoor area in their home.

At Mobelli we vowed to limit the use of wood which requires maintenance, we ensure that we have stock so that you will not have to wait for the furniture and we promise to supply good quality furniture at affordable prices.

Please enjoy our site and our furniture and don’t be shy about telling others about the Mobelli experience.

 * Mobelli Buyback

Why Buy New Furniture When You Can Upgrade Yours Every 5 Years?

All of Mobelli’s clients automatically belong to Mobelli’s innovative loyalty program called the Mobelli Buyback™.

Tastes and circumstances change and you want new furniture that suits your current needs or lifestyle. Instead of throwing out your old furniture, with the Mobelli Buyback™ you can upgrade your existing furniture to brand new furniture at a lower cost. Why not get the best of both worlds? – New furniture at a lower price!

6 short facts about Mobelli Buyback™
1. WHAT IS IT?
A unique program that allows all of our customers to own Mobelli furniture for life.


2. HOW DOES IT WORK?
We look at your original invoice, aged 5 years or more, and determine a value which you can use at Mobelli for upgrading to new furniture. It’s easy. We will deliver your new furniture and collect the old ones.


3. CAN I GET ANY ITEM OF FURNITURE ON A BUYBACK™?
There’s a reason we call it an upgrade. The Buyback offer is available on like-for-like items (a table for a table, couch for a couch). In addition, your new furniture can either be a fresher model of the same collection or have a higher value than the original item.
4. HOW DO I KNOW IF I QUALIFY FOR THE BUYBACK™?
If you have been the original owner of outdoor Mobelli furniture for more than five years then congratulations, you qualify for an upgrade!


5. MY FURNITURE IS NOT IN THE BEST OF SHAPE – WILL I GET LESS MONEY?
The Buyback™ program is guaranteed on all Mobelli indoor and outdoor furniture regardless of its condition.


6. IS THERE A CATCH?
None whatsoever! The decision to upgrade is up to you at any time you feel you want to do so. There is no time limit. The values we use will only be based on the furniture though, and not on cushions.

 * FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions

Here is the content rewritten in a Q&A format:

Q: What is the Mobelli BuybackTM?
A: The Mobelli BuybackTM is an innovative program which allows customers to own Mobelli Furniture For LifeTM by upgrading their furniture every five years or more. It is open to all customers who bought directly from Mobelli.

Q: How does the Mobelli BuybackTM program work? 
A: mobelli looks at your original purchase invoice for goods that you acquired five years ago or longer and determine a value which in turn it allocates for you to have in “credit” with Mobelli. The initial value only takes into account the value of the furniture less transport and cushion costs. You can use this “credit” to upgrade your furniture.

The Mobelli BuyBackTM offer is subject to terms and conditions which Mobelli reserves the right to change at any time regardless of what the terms and conditions were when you bought the furniture.

Q: What is considered an upgrade under the Mobelli BuybackTM program?
A: There are two options that are considered an upgrade:

1 A ‘like for like’ upgrade: This is where the same item or set is exchanged for a newer one. For example, an old Palermo V2 set for a new Palermo V2 set of the same configuration.

2 A higher value upgrade: In this instance, the replacement item is in the same category but must be of higher value than the original item. For example, a six-seater table may be upgraded for another six seater table but only if the latter is priced higher than the original item.

The Mobelli BuyBackTM offer is subject to terms and conditions which Mobelli reserves the right to change at any time regardless of what the terms and conditions were when you bought the furniture.

Q: Is there a situation where the Mobelli BuybackTM upgrade does not apply? 
A: Yes, there are three instances where the Buyback will not apply:

1 The item you wish to purchase is not an upgrade. In other words, it is not a newer version or of higher value than the item you are trading in. 

2 The item you wish to purchase with buyback credit is not a ‘like-for-like’ item. For example, a lounge set cannot be traded in for an umbrella.

3 The Buyback is not offered on cushions. This is because your cushions are priced relatively low compared to the quality. As such the low margins do not leave enough room for us to apply credit or discounts to them.  

If the item you wish to purchase is on the sale, the Buyback offer will not apply.
